# Sally's Stash
## Introduction
&emsp;Sally is a special squirrel who, in addition to burying acorns for the winter, likes to bury gold.<br>
&emsp;In this game, two players will hide gold stacks that come in different sizes in a grid-like layout.<br>
&emsp;As a result, gold can be “buried” using the coordinates in the grid (e.g., [B1-B3], or [D5-G5]).<br>
&emsp;Sally’s stashes come in stacks specific sizes and colors.<br>
&emsp;Both players (player A and player B) have the same stash to hide at the beginning of the game.<br>
&emsp;Each player is using the same device to play.<br>
<br>
## Steps
&emsp;1. Choose if either one or both players are computers.<br>
&emsp;2. Two players place their stacks in their own boards.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Green & purple stacks can be placed horizontally/vertically.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Red & blue stacks can be placed in up/down/right/left order.<br>
&emsp;3. Play begins.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Each player can choose one of the following movements:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Guess the other's stack positions.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Move a stack of himself.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Use a sonar to check the other's board.<br>
